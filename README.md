# Conference-attendees-guide
Collection of Best practices for conference attendees.

## Network with People
- Connect with other attendees. Challenge yourself to meet 3 new people. Lunch can be a great time for this.
- Connect with presenters via twitter or LinkedIn by liking, retweets, and messaging.
- Reach out to others in similar roles in your network and see if they are attending as well.
- Remember the Pac-Man rule: [Pac-Man Rule Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIRQmFObws4)

## Create a Schedule
- Find a timeslot where you aren't as interested in the content and use that time to take a break.
- Research the tracks and topics ahead of time and create a personal schedule.
- Use an extra dose of caution when considering attending a Vendor presentation. They can be glorified advertising.

## Engage
- Take notes on each talk. Focus on summarizing the content and personal action items. Balance this with active listening.
- Ask questions during Q&A. If you disagree or want to challenge a point made, do that privately.
- Instead of re-presenting all the conference content to your company, engage colleagues by having them help accomplish action items.
